This Project manipulates the data that comes from the US government about its industries and  financial status across the country. 
To use, type * src\main.py [DIRECTORY], the directory must contain two files: 1) the data file 2017.annual.single.csv and  2) an directory called area_titles.csv that  gives the correct FIPS codes for that region of the country
It incredible that large data sets like the full USA data set of 3 million + lines of code can be read and processed in only a matter of seconds.

The runtime for USA_Full takes about 9 seconds. Its not that bad compared to the 6 seconds set by the professor.
